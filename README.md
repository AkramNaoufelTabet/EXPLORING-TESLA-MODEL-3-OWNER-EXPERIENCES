#EXPLORING TESLA MODEL 3 OWNER EXPERIENCES


In this project, we apply social media analytics to explore the experiences of electric
vehicle (EV) owners. Using data from platforms like Reddit, YouTube, and others, we aim to
uncover common themes, sentiments, and issues related to EV ownership. Our focus will be on
the Tesla Model 3, a popular choice in the electric vehicle market. The analysis will involve data
collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and text mining to draw meaningful
insights.
